# smc_as_path_access_list (Resource)

This represents an AS Path Access List, which is used to define a list of AS paths for dynamic routing configurations.

## Examples

- see [here](https://github.com/Forcepoint/terraform-provider-fp-ngfw-smc/blob/release/0.0.1/examples/engines/dynamic_routing/BGP/as_path_access_list) for a complete minimal example

This example creates an AS Path Access List to control allowed or denied AS paths for BGP routing.

```hcl
resource "smc_as_path_access_list" "as_path_access_list" {
  comment = var.resource_comment
  entries {
    as_path_access_list_entry {
      action     = "permit"
      expression = "^65001_"
    }
  }
  entries {
    as_path_access_list_entry {
      action     = "deny"
      expression = "_65002$"
    }
  }
  name = "tf_as_path_access_list"
}
```
