- `tracking_mode` (String) The Connection Tracking Mode. 'normal' When selected, the engine drops ICMP error messages related to connections that are not currently active in connection tracking. A valid, complete TCP handshake is required for TCP traffic. The engine checks the traffic direction and the port parameters of UDP traffic. 'strict' When selected, the engine does not permit TCP traffic to pass through before a complete, valid TCP handshake is performed. 'loose' When selected, the engine allows some connection patterns and address translation operations that are not allowed in the Normal mode. Note! You can override this general setting and configure connection tracking for TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic in Access rules.
