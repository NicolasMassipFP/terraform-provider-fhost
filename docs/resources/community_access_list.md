# smc_community_access_list (Resource)

This represents a Community Access List, which is used to define a list of communities for dynamic routing configurations.

## Examples

- see [here](https://github.com/Forcepoint/terraform-provider-fp-ngfw-smc/blob/release/0.0.1/examples/engines/dynamic_routing/BGP/community_access_list) for an example

This example creates a Community Access List to specify accepted or denied BGP communities.

```hcl
resource "smc_community_access_list" "community_access_list" {
  comment = var.resource_comment
  entries {
    community_access_list_entry {
      action    = "deny"
      community = "178"
    }
  }
  entries {
    community_access_list_entry {
      action    = "permit"
      community = "1022"
    }
  }
  name = "tf_community_access_list"
  type = "standard"
}
```
