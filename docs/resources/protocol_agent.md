- `fallback_agent_id` (Number) Internal use: Id of the agent that should be used as a fallback.
- `identifier_situation` (Number) Internal use: Id of the situation (application) which can be used for identifying this protocol.
- `module_build` (String) Dummy module info: build of the sensor module.
- `module_max_version` (String) Dummy module info: Max Version (concatenation between ips and fw max version).
- `module_min_version` (String) Dummy module info: Min Version (concatenation between ips and fw min version).
- `module_name` (String) Dummy module info: name of the sensor module *.so binary file name.
- `module_upload_always` (Boolean) Dummy module info: upload always flag of the sensor module.
- `name` (String) Name of the object.
- `override_module_id` (Number) Overrides the registration number or system key as the module id, if set. Used for inspection module and sidewinder proxy stacked services.
- `protocol_matching_in_inspection` (Boolean) Flag to know if a protocol can be used in inspection policy, for column Protocol. Default value = true
- `registration_number` (Number) Internal use: used by the firewall to reference a protocol agent.
- `supported_protocol` (List of String) List of supported protocols: ethernet, ip-proto, tcp, udp, icmp, physical.

## Nested Attributes
    
- `link_selection` (Single Block, see [here](zzattrs_link_selection_value.md)) 
- `paParameters` (List of Blocks, see [here](zzattrs_abstract_protocol_agent_parameter.md)) The parameters belonging to the protocol agent.
- `paValues` (List of Blocks, see [here](zzattrs_pa_parameter_value.md)) The values belonging to the protocol agent.

## Readonly Attributes
