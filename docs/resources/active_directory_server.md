## Simple Attributes
    
- `address` (String) The primary IPv4 address of the device, which is used for network communication.
- `auth_ipaddress` (String) The IPv4 address used for authentication on the Active Directory server. If the authentication service on the Active Directory server uses a different IP address than the server itself, enter the IPv4 address for authentication.
- `auth_port` (Number) The port number for the Active Directory server authentication.
- `base_dn` (String) The base distinguished name (DN) for the LDAP server, which defines the starting point for user searches.
- `bind_password` (String) The password for the user ID used for binding to the LDAP server.
- `bind_user_id` (String) The distinguished name (DN) of the user ID used for binding to the LDAP server.
- `client_cert_based_user_search` (String) The LDAP query filter used to find user entries based on client certificate subject distinguished name.
- `comment` (String) An optional comment for the element. This field is not required.
- `display_name_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the display name in the LDAP directory.
- `email` (String) The attribute name used for the user's email address in the LDAP directory.
- `frame_ip_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the framed IP address in the LDAP directory.
- `group_member_attr` (String) The attribute name used for group membership in the LDAP directory.
- `group_object_class` (List of String) The LDAP object classes used for group entries in the LDAP directory.
- `group_object_id_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the unique identifier of the LDAP group object in the LDAP directory.
- `internet_auth_service_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the IAS service is enabled on the Active Directory server.
- `ipv6_address` (String) The primary IPv6 address of the device, which is used for network communication.
- `job_title_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the user's job title in the LDAP directory.
- `location_ref` (String) This represents the definition of a Location, which keeps a list of Network Elements belonging to the same location.
- `long_user_id_attr` (String) The attribute name used for the user's UPN in the LDAP directory.
- `max_search_result` (Number) The maximum number of LDAP entries that can be returned in a search result.
- `mobile_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the user's mobile phone number in the LDAP directory.
- `name` (String) Name of the object.
- `office_location_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the user's office location in the LDAP directory.
- `page_size` (Number) The maximum number of LDAP entries returned on each page of the LDAP response.
- `photo_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the user's photo in the LDAP directory.
- `port` (Number) The port number for the LDAP server, which is used for communication.
- `protocol` (String) The protocol used for LDAP communication, such as ldap, ldaps, or ldap_tls.
- `retries` (Number) The number of times the Firewalls try to connect to the RADIUS or TACACS+ authentication server if the connection fails.
