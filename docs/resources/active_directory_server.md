# smc_active_directory_server (Resource)

This represents an Active Directory Server, which is used to store user information in a user database and can be queried during the user authentication process. It includes attributes for authentication IP, domain controllers, IAS service, retries, shared secret, and authentication port.

## Examples

- see [here](https://github.com/Forcepoint/terraform-provider-fp-ngfw-smc/blob/release/0.0.1/examples/network_elements/servers/active_directory_server) for a complete minimal example

This example creates an Active Directory server object in SMC with typical LDAP configuration attributes and associates it with an authentication service.

```hcl
resource "smc_active_directory_server" "ad" {
  address                       = "myad.example.com"
  comment                       = var.resource_comment
  auth_port                     = 1812
  base_dn                       = "dc=example,dc=com"
  bind_password                 = "my_bind_password00!!"
  bind_user_id                  = "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"
  client_cert_based_user_search = ""
  display_name_attr_name        = "displayName"
  email                         = "mail"
  frame_ip_attr_name            = "msRADIUSFramedIPAddress"
  group_member_attr             = "member"
  group_object_class            = ["sggroup", "groupOfNames", "country", "organization", "organizationalUnit", "group"]
  # group_object_id_attr_name = ""
  internet_auth_service_enabled = true
  job_title_attr_name           = "title"
  # long_user_id_attr = "userPrincipalName"
  max_search_result         = 0
  mobile_attr_name          = "mobile"
  name                      = "ad"
  office_location_attr_name = "physicalDeliveryOfficeName"
  page_size                 = 1000
  photo_attr_name           = "photo"
  port                      = 389
  protocol                  = "ldap"
  retries                   = 2
  secondary                 = []
  shared_secret             = "*****"
  # short_user_id_attr = "sAMAccountName"
  supported_method  = [data.smc_href.user_password_auth_method.id]
  timeout           = 10
  user_object_class = ["sguser", "person", "organizationalPerson", "inetOrgPerson"]
}
```


## Simple Attributes
- `id` (String) this attribute is the identifier of terraform resource
- `address` (String) The primary IPv4 address of the device, which is used for network communication.
- `auth_ipaddress` (String) The IPv4 address used for authentication on the Active Directory server. If the authentication service on the Active Directory server uses a different IP address than the server itself, enter the IPv4 address for authentication.
- `auth_port` (Number) The port number for the Active Directory server authentication.
- `base_dn` (String) The base distinguished name (DN) for the LDAP server, which defines the starting point for user searches.
- `bind_password` (String) The password for the user ID used for binding to the LDAP server.
- `bind_user_id` (String) The distinguished name (DN) of the user ID used for binding to the LDAP server.
- `client_cert_based_user_search` (String) The LDAP query filter used to find user entries based on client certificate subject distinguished name.
- `comment` (String) An optional comment for the element. This field is not required.
- `display_name_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the display name in the LDAP directory.
- `email` (String) The attribute name used for the user's email address in the LDAP directory.
- `frame_ip_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the framed IP address in the LDAP directory.
- `group_member_attr` (String) The attribute name used for group membership in the LDAP directory.
- `group_object_class` (List of String) The LDAP object classes used for group entries in the LDAP directory.
- `group_object_id_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the unique identifier of the LDAP group object in the LDAP directory.
- `internet_auth_service_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the IAS service is enabled on the Active Directory server.
- `ipv6_address` (String) The primary IPv6 address of the device, which is used for network communication.
- `job_title_attr_name` (String) The attribute name used for the user's job title in the LDAP directory.
- `location_ref` (String) This represents the definition of a Location, which keeps a list of Network Elements belonging to the same location.
- `long_user_id_attr` (String) The attribute name used for the user's UPN in the LDAP directory.
- `max_search_result` (Number) The maximum number of LDAP entries that can be returned in a search result.
