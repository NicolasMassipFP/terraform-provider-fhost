# smc_ip_prefix_list (Resource)

This represents an IP Prefix List, which is used to define a list of IP prefixes for dynamic routing configurations.

## Examples

- see [here](https://github.com/Forcepoint/terraform-provider-fp-ngfw-smc/blob/release/0.0.1/examples/engines/dynamic_routing/ip_prefix_list) for a minimal example

This example creates an IP prefix list for BGP/OSPF filtering.

```hcl
resource "smc_ip_prefix_list" "ip_prefixl_list" {
  comment = var.resource_comment
  entries {
    ip_prefix_list_entry {
      action            = "permit"
      max_prefix_length = 28
      min_prefix_length = 25
      subnet            = "192.168.1.0/24"
    }
  }
  entries {
    ip_prefix_list_entry {
      action            = "deny"
      max_prefix_length = 26
      min_prefix_length = 25
      subnet            = "10.100.100.0/24"
    }
  }
  name = "tf_ip_prefixl_list"
}
```

- `comment` (String) An optional comment for the element. This field is not required.
- `name` (String) Name of the object.

## Nested Attributes
