# smc_router (Resource)

This represents a Router, which is a Network Element representing a physical router in your network. Most often used to indicate next-hop routers in the Routing view and in Network Diagrams.

## Examples

- [getting_started/main.tf](https://github.com/Forcepoint/terraform-provider-fp-ngfw-smc/blob/release/0.0.1/examples/getting_started/main.tf): Basic router creation for a test network and single firewall setup.

This snippet demonstrates fundamental usage of the `smc_router` resource, defining a router with a static IP address and a name. It is used to route traffic within a test lab topology.

```hcl
resource "smc_router" "tf_sample_router" {
  address = local.tf_router
  name    = "tf_sample_router"
  comment = var.resource_comment
}
```


## Simple Attributes
- `id` (String) this attribute is the identifier of terraform resource
- `address` (String) The primary IPv4 address of the device, which is used for network communication.
- `comment` (String) An optional comment for the element. This field is not required.
- `ipv6_address` (String) The primary IPv6 address of the device, which is used for network communication.
- `location_ref` (String) This represents the definition of a Location, which keeps a list of Network Elements belonging to the same location.
- `name` (String) Name of the object.
- `secondary` (List of String) A list of secondary IP addresses for the device, which can be used in policies and routing. You can add several IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (one by one).
- `tools_profile_ref` (String) This represents a Tools Profile. Tools Profiles add commands to the right-click menus of elements, allowing dynamic information inclusion from the element definition. Only one Tools Profile can be selected for each element, but each can include several commands. Commands are launched on the workstation running the Management Client and are operating-system-specific.

## Nested Attributes
- `third_party_monitoring` (Single Block, see [here](attr_third_party_monitoring.md)) 

## Readonly Attributes
- `admin_domain` (String) This represents a Domain. Domains are administrative boundaries that allow you to separate the configuration details and other information in the system for the purpose of limiting administrator access.
- `etag` (String) The ETag of the element, used for versioning. This field is not required.
- `key` (Number) The unique identifier for the element. This field is required for updates but not for creation.
- `link` (List of Blocks, see [here](attr_api_link.md)) The API's links of the element, providing additional actions or resources.
- `locked` (Boolean) Indicates if the element is locked. This field is not required.
- `read_only` (Boolean) Indicates if the element is read-only. This field is not required.
- `system` (Boolean) Indicates if the element is a System element. This field is not required.
- `system_key` (Number) The system key of the System element. This field is not required.
- `trashed` (Boolean) Indicates if the element is trashed. This field is not required.
