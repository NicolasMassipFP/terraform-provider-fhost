# smc_match_expression (Resource)

This element represents the Rule Source/Destination/Service Match expression, which defines how traffic is matched against rules in a policy.

## Examples

- [fw_policy_with_match_expression/main.tf](https://github.com/Forcepoint/terraform-provider-fp-ngfw-smc/blob/release/0.0.1/examples/policies/fw_policy_with_match_expression/main.tf): Builds a match expression referencing multiple resources in a firewall policy.

This snippet shows an `smc_match_expression` referencing a host and a network, for use in access rules for refined traffic matching.

```hcl
resource "smc_match_expression" "match_expression_host1_net1" {
  name = "tf_match_expression_host1_net1"
  ref  = [smc_network.network_1.id, smc_host.host_1.id]
}
```
