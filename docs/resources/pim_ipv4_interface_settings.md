# smc_pim_ipv4_interface_settings (Resource)

This represents the PIM IPv4 Interface Settings for Dynamic Routing Firewall functionality.

## Examples

- [PIM IPv4 Interface Settings Example](https://github.com/Forcepoint/terraform-provider-fp-ngfw-smc/blob/release/0.0.1/examples/engines/dynamic_routing/PIM/pim_ipv4_interface_settings/main.tf)

Defines PIM-specific multicast settings for a given interface.

```hcl
resource "smc_pim_ipv4_interface_settings" "pim_interface_settings" {
  dr_priority               = 14
  igmp_querier_settings_ref = data.smc_href.igmp_querier_settings.id
  name                      = "tf_pim_interface_settings"
  random_delay              = 10
  zbr                       = "224.0.1.1,239.255.255.250"
  comment                   = var.resource_comment
}
```
